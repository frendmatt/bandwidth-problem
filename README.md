# bandwidth-problem
Best attempt at a heuristic for the NP Hard Graph Bandwidth Problem from CSE 373 (Analysis of Algorithms)
### How to run:
My program is ran through the command line. All my tests were done from the console
inside my IDE, IntelliJ. The program requires a txt file called "test.txt" which is a graph formatted as the first line being the number of vertices, the next line is the number of edges and then is followed by all the edges. I have included a test.txt with a simple binary tree.

The program returns the minimum graph bandwidth of the graph as well as the time it took to complete the calculation.
